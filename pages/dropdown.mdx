# Dropdown Component

**Contributed by Chaoyang Li**

Dropdown allow users to choose from a list of options in a limited space. The list of options can change based on the context.

## Basic Component
The select tag can be used to create a dropdown component.
<Dropdown />

## Variants

### With dividers
The optgroup tag is used to group related options in a drop-down list.
<WithDividers />

### With icons
You can add icons to the options in the dropdown. The select tag doesn't support this requirement.
<WithIcons />

### With header
A Simple header in the dropdown can show the current status. The select tag doesn't support this requirement.
<WithHeader />

## Usability

### Include a label
<details>
    <summary>Include a label</summary>
    Every picker should have a label. A picker without a label is ambiguous and not accessible.
</details>

### Keep menu items concise
<details>
    <summary>Keep menu items concise</summary>
    Keep menu items short and concise. Long menu items that cause text to wrap to multiple lines are discouraged. If text wrapping becomes a frequent concern, consider revising the text or use alternative UI patterns that will give your content more space.

### Choose an appropriate width

    <summary>Choose an appropriate width</summary>
    When possible, the field button width should be wide enough so that any chosen menu items can be displayed in full.
