**Contributed by Chaoyang Li**

File upload component allow users to choose local files and upload them to server.

## Basic Component
The input tag with 'file' type can be used to create a file upload.

### Always show the limitation to the users
<details>
    <summary>Always show the limitation to the users</summary>
    If you set any limitation to the uploading file, Using help text to emphasize those limitation.
</details>

### Add preview if you can
<details>
    <summary>Add preview if you can</summary>
    It is very help for user to let them seeing what they uploaded. The preview of the uploaded file can effectively reduce the upload of incorrect files.
</details>

### Don't set restrictions too strict
<details>
    <summary>Don't set restrictions too strict</summary>
    Not every users have basic knowledge of the IT world, too strict restrictions can wearing down users' patience. For example, if you set the maximum size of the image are 0.5MB, it is very hard for user to find such small image with the help of compression tool. If the users doesn't know how to use an image compression tool, or doesn't even know the existence of this kind of tool, they probably will never complete the upload.

## Accessibility
The input tag supports keyboard operation.
