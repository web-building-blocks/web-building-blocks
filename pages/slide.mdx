## Usability

<details>
    <summary>Make slide looks actionable</summary>
    Make sure the button or switch circle of your slide obvious, otherwise the user may think it is just a image.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Don't switch images too fast</summary>
    If you make your slide autoplay, make sure users have enough time to read the content before next switch. If you set the speed of autoplay too fast, like 1 second per switch, it can ruin users experience.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Add details of image if necessary</summary>
    For some images of location or person, text details often help users understand the content of images.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Set the size of preview image appropriately</summary>
    The size of the preview image should not be too large or too small.

    A preview image that is too large will make the slide itself meaningless. (Why use slide instead of displaying the entire image?) A preview image that is too small will make it difficult for users to see the general content of the image, making the preview image itself meaningless.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Don’t put too many or too few images on the slide</summary>
    Before you decide to use a slide to display something, you need to think about whether the slide is suitable.

    If you put too many images into the slide (more than 10), users will need to click too many times to fully view them all. If you put too few pictures in the slide (less than 3 pictures), maybe you don’t need to use the slide, and a photo wall may be more suitable for you.
